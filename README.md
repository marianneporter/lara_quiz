## Lara Quiz

A quiz application written in Laravel

The quiz gets it's questions from  The Trivia API  https://the-trivia-api.com/.

The app uses Laravel, PHP and Tailwind.

Unusually for me, it contains no JavaScript.  All of the processing is done server side.

A working verson of the app can be found at https://lara-quiz-1a71244db678.herokuapp.com/quiz/results
